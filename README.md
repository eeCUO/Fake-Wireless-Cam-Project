# PCB Design: The Lifecycle of an Electronic Board Course Completion  

Hello,  

I am eeCUO, and I am excited to announce that I have successfully completed the **PCB Design: The Lifecycle of an Electronic Board** course. This course offers a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to step into the world of electronic circuit design and PCB (Printed Circuit Board) development.  

Throughout the course, I gained in-depth knowledge of the entire lifecycle of an electronic board, from the design phase to production. The curriculum covers critical topics such as selecting electronic components, creating circuit schematics, PCB layout design, manufacturing processes, and testing stages. It combines both theoretical and practical knowledge, making it highly valuable for learners.  

## Tools and Software I Learned:  
- **LTSpice:** I learned how to perform circuit simulations to verify the accuracy of designs.  
- **Altium Designer:** I gained hands-on experience with this powerful software for professional PCB design.  
- **Saturn PCB Toolkit:** I used this tool for calculations and optimizing design rules in PCB development.  

### Key Technical Details Covered:  
- **Noise Reduction:** Methods to minimize electrical noise in PCB layouts.  
- **Impedance Matching:** Ensuring proper impedance for signal transmission.  
- **Manufacturing File Preparation:** Generating Gerber, NC Drill, and BOM files for production.  

Below are some screenshots of the project:
